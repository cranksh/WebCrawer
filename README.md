# Super Web Crawler

Super Web Crawler is a Python script that allows you to crawl a website and extract various information, such as the page title, links, and other tags. It utilizes the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pyfiglet`, and `colorama` libraries to fetch web pages, parse HTML content, and provide an enhanced console output.

## Features

- Crawls a specified website and extracts information from web pages.

- Retrieves the page title and displays it in the console output.

- Extracts and prints all the links found on the page.

- Supports recursive crawling up to a specified maximum depth.

- Displays an ASCII logo using the `pyfiglet` library.

- Provides a visually appealing console output using color coding with the `colorama` library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above

- `requests` library: Install using `pip install requests`

- `BeautifulSoup` library: Install using `pip install beautifulsoup4`

- `pyfiglet` library: Install using `pip install pyfiglet`

- `colorama` library: Install using `pip install colorama`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file `web_crawler.py` to your local machine.

2. Install the required libraries using the commands mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script file is located.

4. Run the script using the command `python web_crawler.py`.

5. Enter the URL of the website you want to crawl when prompted.

6. Enter the maximum depth to crawl when prompted. This determines how many levels deep the crawler will traverse.

7. The script will start crawling the website and display the page title, links, and other tags found on each page.

## Customization

- You can customize the tags you want to extract by modifying the `tags_to_extract` list in the script. Add or remove tag names as per your requirements.

- Feel free to modify the ASCII logo generated by `pyfiglet` to suit your preferences. Update the `logo` variable in the script with your desired ASCII art.

- Adjust the color codes provided by `colorama` library in the script to customize the console output colors as desired.

## Limitations

- The script may not handle certain edge cases or complex website structures. It's recommended for basic website crawling purposes.

- Use the script responsibly and respect the website's terms of service and crawling policies. Avoid excessive crawling or overwhelming the target website's server.
